# Task 1
Generalize gen_bin_tree for K-ary trees

Write predicate gen_K_Tree(K, Tree) such that given K in Tree can be generated
every K-ary (rooted) tree with vertecies natural numbers.

# Task 2
Write predicate gen_Tree(T) wich can generate in T every rooted tree with vertecies natural numbers.

# Taks 3
List X is special if every element of X is 3 element list.
list Y is X-coherent if X is special list and for each A and B elements of Y [A, A, B] is element of X.

Implement check(X, Y) wich checks is Y is X-coherent list.
Implement split_check(X, Y) wich checks if for some P and S it is true that Y = P o S and P and S are X-coherent
where P o S is the concatenation of P and S.
